PyCity Schools Analysis
As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually (585 per student)
and the schools with the highest budget per student have the lowest pass percentage 73.65%.

As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
